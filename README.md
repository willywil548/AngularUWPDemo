# AngularUWPDemo

This application was made to be a shell for future UWP angular driven applications. Please find the how-to.pdf for the step by step.
This was made to be a pull and develop solution, to do this you must unzip the node_modules in the directory which it is found.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0 and Visual Studios 17.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Out of the box, open in VS and start the debugger as is and it should build and run without issues. Please refer to the how-to to edit.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
